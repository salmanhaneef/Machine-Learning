# Dataset Preparation and Machine Learning Modeling

This project focuses on the cleaning and preparation of a dataset for Machine Learning (ML) models, followed by applying hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation using various metrics. Additionally, model interpretability techniques like LIME and SHAP are implemented to understand the models' behavior.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset and the cleaned dataset post-processing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks that document the step-by-step process of data cleaning, model training, and interpretability analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model implementation.
- `results/`: Stores the results of model performance and visualizations.
- `models/`: Saved models after training.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `LIME`
  - `SHAP`

## Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
The dataset is cleaned by:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical data into numerical format (if required)
- Normalizing or standardizing the features

The cleaned dataset is then prepared for training Machine Learning models.

### 2. Model Training
The following Machine Learning models are trained:
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is applied using techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the model performance.

### 4. Performance Evaluation
After training, the models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R2)

These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and error.

### 5. Model Interpretability
To enhance model transparency, two popular interpretability techniques are applied:
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: Helps to explain individual predictions by approximating the model locally with a simpler model.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Provides a game-theoretic approach to explain the output of any ML model by assigning each feature an importance value.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to follow the data cleaning and model training steps.

4. Run the LIME and SHAP analysis to interpret the model predictions.

## Results

The final results, including model evaluation metrics and interpretability insights, are stored in the `results/` folder. The models themselves are saved in the `models/` folder for future use.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the full workflow of data preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretability using LIME and SHAP. By using these techniques, we gain insights not only into model performance but also into how the models make decisions.
